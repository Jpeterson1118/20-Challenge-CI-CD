  ## Usage
  The CI/CD pipeline utilizes Github actions, triggered when a merge request to the develop of default branch is triggered. When merging to the develop branch tests are run automatically and must be passed in order to complete the merge.

  When a merge request is made for the default branch the same tests are run and must be passed before completeing the merge. When the merge is complete the tests will run again and the site will automatically be deployed to render.

  The deployed site may be visted at the link below.
